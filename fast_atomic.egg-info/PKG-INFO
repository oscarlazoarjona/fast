Description: FAST
        ====
        This is FAST, an acronym for FAST Atomic Spectroscopy from Theory.
        
        This software derives and solves optical Bloch equations efficiently. This can
        be done for an arbitrary number of atomic states and radiation fields. The
        equations are used primarily to produce theoretical spectra.
        
        A library of properties of alkali atoms (currently rubidium and cesium) is
        included to produce physically accurate equations from first principles or
        from tables of measured quantities.
        
        Symbolic derivations of the equations are also implemented.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        This software requieres gfortran, numpy, matplotlib, lapack, sympy and scipy to
        run. This is done in the following steps:
        
        **1.-** Install the Python dependencies by installing Anaconda, that is Continuum's
        Python distribution from https://www.continuum.io/downloads
        
        **2.-** Install the non-Python dependencies.
        In Ubuntu, the fortran dependencies (and git) can be installed with:
        ::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install gfortran liblapack-dev git
        
        Other operative systems are not supported at the moment, but FAST should become
        OS independent in the following releases (with Fortran being optional).
        
        **3.-** Install FAST.
        To get the latest stable version of FAST use the command:
        ::
        
            $ pip install fast-atomic
        
        To get the latest unstable version (this requires git):
        ::
        
            $ pip install git+git://github.com/oscarlazoarjona/fast
        
        To upgrade to the latest stable version:
        ::
        
            $ pip install fast-atomic --upgrade
        
        To upgrade to the latest unstable version (this requires git):
        ::
        
            $ pip install git+git://github.com/oscarlazoarjona/fast --upgrade
        
        To uninstall:
        ::
        
            $ pip uninstall fast-atomic
        
        Using FAST
        ----------
        
        Once this completed example jupyter notebooks can be downloaded from
        https://github.com/oscarlazoarjona/fast-notebooks
        
        And they can be ran using
        ::
        
            $ jupyter notebook
        
        Enjoy!
